/* 
- Two main types of Javascript code

Two types of EXECUTION CONTEXT
- global execution context
- function execution context

- only one GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT which is created when the JS program starts

- whereas a new FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT is created on each function invocation

- FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT is an object on which our function is invoked, which

WARNING: Dont confuse FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT with EXECUTION CONTEXT.

- EXECUTION CONTEXT is an internal Js concept which it uses to track the execution
- of our functions.

- Js is single-threaded. One piece of code is executed at a time. 
- Everytime a function is invoked. current execution context is stopped
- new function context is created. After function perform its task
- function execution context is discarded. And Caller ( the function which called it )
- execution context is restored.

- EXECUTION CONTEXT STACK is used to keep track of all these execution contexts- both
- one that's executing and one that is waiting. 

- STACK is a Data Structure in which you can put new items only to top and can

Let's take a closer look: outerFunction2() returns a reference to the inner, nested function. The return value of this invocation is saved in result. When this function is called, it maintains access to its scope; that is, all the variables it was able to access back when it was originally defined. This includes the num1 variable in its parent scope. The nested function closes over these variables, and those variables persist as long as the reference to the function itself exists.

When result(10); is executed, then, the function is still able to access num1's value of 5. As a result, 15 is logged to the console.
